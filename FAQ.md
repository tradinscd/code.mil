#Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

##What is Code.mil?

Code.mil is an experiment in open source at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The goal is to collaborate with the developer community across the world on unclassified code written by U.S. Federal government employees. 

##Who is behind Code.mil?

The [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil) (DDS) launched Code.mil on February 23, 2017. DDS is part of the [United States Digital Service](https://usds.gov).

##What happened to the draft Defense Open Source Agreement released on February 22, 2017?

We received a lot of great feedback about the draft agreement and our proposed use of contract law as a legal pathway to use open source licenses for our projects. Thank you! 

Based on the feedback, we updated our strategy to move away from contract law and instead focus on the contribution process. We deleted the LICENSE-agreement.md file. Our updated strategy is fully captured in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/Proposal/CONTRIBUTING.md). We think the updated strategy avoids the complications of using contract law and also the perception that we're creating new licenses. We hope this will keep our practices more consistent with the open source and free software communities. We intend to use widely adopted licenses for our projects.

##Since software created by U.S. Federal government employees does not have copyright protections in the U.S., why not just put it in the public domain and use CC0 1.0 for international jurisdictions where you have copyright?

Good point! We definitely considered this. However, we felt that simply placing it in the public domain and attaching a CC0 1.0 dedication wouldn’t sufficiently address the legalities of an individual’s contribution. We do not intend to judge this strategy, but we would like to explore the possiblitiy of using widely adopted licenses other than CC0 1.0.

The legal framework that makes works created by U.S. Federal government employees ineligible for copyright protections was written long before the invention of software. This concept was first codified to a lesser degree in the Printing Law of 1895 and then again in the U.S. Copyright Act of 1909. Section 108 from the Act of 1909 served as the basis for the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, which is the current law (17 U.S.C. 105). 

We believe that software created by the U.S. Federal government should be shared when possible so that it can be used and improved upon by the public. However, software is a different animal than maps or publications. Software constantly evolves with each contribution potentially having a different copyright and license status. Merely placing source code in the public domain with CC0 1.0 does not address how contributions will affect the openness of the project over time.

That’s why we’re trying this new approach of using the contribution process via the Developer Certificate of Origin to attach widely adopted licenses to our projects. We believe that this resolves the legal status of contributions while also remaining consistent with the intent of 17 U.S.C. 105. We're not only making government software available to the public, but also openly encouraging participation in making the code better.

##Why is DoD doing this?

U.S. military members and their families make significant sacrifices to protect our country. Their lives should not be negatively impacted by outdated tools and software development practices that lag far behind private sector standards.

Modern software is open sourced software. The creative contribution of individual developers to help solve complex problems of impact is largely untapped by DoD. Through this experiment, we are trying to more actively participate in the open source and free software communities. We need your help to build better software products and services for our military members and citizens across the country.

##Can I fork the code and do whatever I want?

Yes, but we hope you will consider collaborating with us.

##Is DoD trying to do something funny here?

No!

We mean to be totally transparent in our intent and purpose with Code.mil. Since we’re trying a slightly different approach to open source our work, we want to be really clear about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it so that you feel comfortable contributing to our projects.
