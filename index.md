# Defense Digital Service Recommendations for Open Source DoD Projects

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) faces unique challenges in open sourcing its code. Unlike most software projects, code written by U.S. Federal government employees typically doesnâ€™t have copyright protections under U.S. and some international laws. This can make it hard to attach an open source license to our code, and our team here at Defense Digital Service wants to find a solution.

Defense Digital Service has resources available to assist U.S. Department of Defense agencies in evaluating its software projects for general release. Please see:

* [Defense Digital Service Recommendations for Open Source DoD Projects](implementation-guide.md)

Or contact us for personal assistance in applying these recommendations to your agency's project.

## This project's goal

We are motivated to help the U.S. Department of Defense maintain technical superiority by engaging the brightest public minds in its projects. This best practice is openly embraced in the private sector and we are helping adopt this practice in the public sector.

## Get involved

Please see our project page at https://github.com/deptofdefense/code.mil/ to participate in updating our recommendations.
