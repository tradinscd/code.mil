This is _**just**_ a placeholder.

This would normally be the open source license selected for the project.

The intent is to use licenses like MIT, BSD-3, ISC, or Apache 2.0. We hope to also support GPLv3 for a project, but that is more complicated.

This is still a work-in-progress. We would appreciate your input!
